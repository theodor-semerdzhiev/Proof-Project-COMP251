In order to run HeapSortplot.py in your terminal, follow these steps if you have no idea how:

1- Download the latest version of Python (ideally)

2- You need to download 3 libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas

Run these commands into your terminal: 

- pip install numpy

- pip install Matplotlib

- pip install Pandas

(This will install the latest version of those libraries)
Pip (Python package manager) should come with your Python download 
(if you don't have Python installed already).

You can now run HeapSortplot.py and BinaryTreeplot.py in your terminal.

A Jupyter Notebook is also available (HeapSortplot.ipynb), if your IDE is set up for it and you are comfortable with it.

Depending on your machine, the Runtime scripts take a while to run (especially for the binary tree).
Therefore I suggest just using the already written CSV files (PLEASE DON'T RUN THE RUNTIME PROGRAMS BY ACCIDENT, THEY MIGHT OVERWRITE THE CVS FILES).

To run the Java Code, please make sure you have the latest version of JDE, and that your IDE recognizes the libraries getting imported.

Enjoy.
