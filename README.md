In order to run HeapSortplot.py in your terminal, follow these steps if you have no idea how:

1- Download latest version of python (ideally)

2- You need to download 3 libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas

Run these commands into your terminal: 

- pip install Numpy

- pip install Matplotlib

- pip install Pandas

(This will install the latest version of those libraries)
Pip (python package manager) should come with your python download 
(if you don't have python installed already).

You can now run HeapSortplot.py and BinaryTreeplot.py in your terminal.

A Jupyter Notebook is also available (HeapSortplot.ipynb), if your IDE is setup for it and your comfortable with it.

The Runtime scripts take a while to run (especially for the binary tree) depending on your machine.
Therefor I suggest just using the already written cvs files (PLEASE DON'T RUN THE RUNTIME PROGRAMS BY ACCIDENT, THEY MIGHT OVERWRITE THE CVS FILES).

To be able to run the Java Code, make sure you have the latest version of JDE, and that the libraries getting imported are recognized by your IDE.

Enjoy.
